#+CAPTION: Mobile-phone Subscriptions (billion/year)
[[./img/2010.jpg]]

1. 
   1. From the information given in the above column chart, we can see a striking contrast between developing and developed countries in mobile-phone subscriptions from 2000 to 2008.

      根据以上柱状图提供的信息, 我们可以看出, 从 2000 年到 2008 年, 发展中国家和发达国家在手机入网方面存在着惊人的对比.

   2. During this period, there has been a dramatic increase from 0.4 to 4 billion mobile phone subscriptions in developing countries, while that of developed countries remained steady at just under 1 billion.

      在此期间, 发展中国家手机入网数从 4 亿急速增长到 40 亿, 而发达国家的相关数据在 10 亿之下保持平稳.

2. 
   1. At least two fundamental factors could have contributed to this phenomenon.

      至少有两点主要原因造成了这种现象.

   2. On the one hand, with the rapid increase in economic development happening in the developing countries, the telecommunication industry in those countries expanded greatly to meet the demand of globalization.

      一方面, 随着在发展中国家发生的快速经济增长, 这些国家的电信产业必然会适应全球化的需求.

   3. As a result, the user base of mobile phones which can narrow the distance between people and link the whole world together, grew at an incredible speed.

      因此, 使用手机缩短人们之间的距离并与全世界联系的人数以惊人的速度增长.

   4. On the other hand, the extremely advanced civilization of developed countries means less potential in many aspects including in the area of private telecommunication tools and their demand for further enlargement of such tools tends to saturate.

      另一方面,发达国家极端先进的文明在私人电信工具等诸多领域意味着更少的发展潜力, 他们对进一步开发此类工具的需求趋于饱和.

3. 
   1. In conclusion, while mobile phones subscriptions, if used carelessly or without restraint, could prove to be a double-edged sword,

      因此, 如果不小心或没有节制, 手机入网就是一把双刃剑.

   2. the fact remains that such phones are already extremely prevalent in both developing and developed countries and even today continue to rise in popularity.

      但事实上, 手机入网在发展中国家和发达国家中均十分流行, 这种趋势甚至今天还在继续扩大.

   3. If people could imbue themselves with intelligence, prudence and discretion, I am sure that most of them will be able to sidestep the potential drawbacks of mobile phones while taking advantage of all the merits.

      假如人们多动脑、谨慎些、具有判断力, 我确信大多数人都能克服手机的弊端, 并且利用其优势.

*** 2012 年: 年龄与工作满意度
Directions:
Write an essay based on the following table. In your writing you should
1) describe the table, and
2) give your comments.
You should write at least 150 words.

#+CAPTION: ﻿某公司员工工作满意度调查
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil
[[./img/2012.jpg]]

1. 
   1. The table clearly reflects the statistics of staff's job satisfaction in a certain company.

      ﻿这张表格清楚地反映了某公司员工工作满意度的统计数据.

   2. According to the data given above, we can conclude that the percentage of people satisfied with their jobs is highest among those over 50 years old, at about 40%.

      ﻿根据给出的数据, 我们可以看出 50 岁以上的人工作满意度最高, 约为 40%.

   3. In contrast, the percentage of the staff not satisfied with their jobs is about 64% among those in their forties,the highest among all the three age groups.

      ﻿相反, 41 至 50 岁之间的人在三个群体中不满意度最高, 约为 64%.

2. 
   1. The major determinant of satisfaction lies in people's attitudes.

      ﻿主要的决定因素是人们的态度.

   2. On the one hand, staff members in their forties usually have to undertake a lot of responsibilities from both their families and their career.

      ﻿一方面, 41 至 50 岁之间的员工通常不得不承担来自于家庭和事业的双重责任.

   3. Sometimes they are even under pressure to pursue money, power, high social status, and so on, which are all symbols of success.

      ﻿有时他们甚至承受着获取金钱、权力、较高的社会地位等压力, 而这些都象征着成功.

   4. So, they have the least satisfaction in their job.

      ﻿因此, 他们对工作的满意度最低.

   5. On the other hand, people over 50 generally have shifted their life goals from achieving the ultimate success to a relatively easy and comfortable life, and therefore are inclined to be much more satisfied with their jobs.

      ﻿另一方面, 50 岁以上的人通常已经将人生目标从实现最终的成功转变为一种相对轻松、舒适的生活, 因而更容易对工作感到满意.

3. 
   1. In view of the above reasoning, I am convinced that it is difficult for everyone to be content with their jobs.

      ﻿鉴于上述论证, 我认为很难做到每个人都对工作满意.

   2. And it is advisable that people should adjust their expectations for work, and that companies should pay more attention to the welfare of their staff.
